Help on Web API
- Add Web API project to the solution
- Add connection string in appsettings.json
- Add a employee controller
- Attach EmployeeDb.mdf to the localhost sql server by opening SSMS and right-click on database and attach EmployeeDb.mdf. 
  All the folders leading to EmployeeDb.mdf should allow "Everyone" user to have full permission so that it becomes visible for attaching from SSMS.
