Help on Blazor
- There are two types - i. client side (webassembly) and ii. server side
- To use the same code for two different types of Blazor applications, you need to create three projects i. client side ii. server side ii. razor class library
  then you you will reference the razor class library in both the client and server side blazor applications. So the main code in razor class library will be
  reusable to both applications.
- To update the application while running in a browser, open tools -> command line -> developer command prompt and go to the balzor application folder and run >dotnet watch run 
  This will start the application and automatically update in the browser whenever you make changes to your application.
- Any variable that you use in the code-behind file needs to be initialized if you want to use it in the razor file.
- If you make changes to App.css, then you need to ctrl+F5 the browser to update app.css
- Code-behind file names are recommended to be the same as *.razor or *.razor.cs with a partial class or razor can have @code{} block. Partial class names need to be the same as razor file name.
